	Automated testing increases efficiency since there is regular feedback \ 
from the system after a problem is found and tested. The development process becomes \
more streamlined since bugs are found early and fixed before the user has time to \ 
complain. Automated testing is a part of the DevOps process flow and keeps a company \
on good terms with its customers, keeping a company competitive. It is part of continuous \
integration (**include reference here to Shannon’s file**) since the updated code from the \ developers is tested automatically. This allows developers to see if their software \
breaks sooner rather than later, giving them more time to fix it. As long as the company’s \ automated testing environment is reliable, then the company can remain competitive and productive. 

	Martin Fowler mentions a test pyramid on his website that helps visualize the \ tests required and their different layers. The pyramid was created by Mike Cohn and is a \ concept that can be used for automated testing. (**insert image of pyramid below**) \ Basically, for faster testing results it is better to write a bunch of small tests for \ units, some service tests, and very few high-level tests since these are slower and require \ more integration. Otherwise, it would be difficult to maintain the fast turnaround of automated testing.
