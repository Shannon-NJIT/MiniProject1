# Code Repetition **(Do Not Repeat Yourself)**

Code repetition is frowned down upon in programming and is seen as unprofessional. An example of code repetition would be if a programmer used “System.out.println()” for every single method in their code. Normally, this is done in assignments of students who are learning how to code and are testing that the methods display the data correctly (see Figure 1 below where System.out.println(“ “) is repeated multiple times). However, this shows that the programmer does not meet industry standards and did not think to create a method specifically for printing. In the programming world, functions that do one and only one thing are a tool to not repeat yourself in your code.
