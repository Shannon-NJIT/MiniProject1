# METHOD

Methods are actions that an [object](https://github.com/Shannon-NJIT/MiniProject1/blob/master/Object.md) can do on itself. A static method is just an action. For example, this would be something that you cannot buy in the store such as addition.” Methods are functions that are used to access the attributes of a class. An example of a method is “return_data_as_objects” in Figure 1 for [property/attribute](https://github.com/Shannon-NJIT/MiniProject1/blob/master/Property.md). Figure 1 of [Class](https://github.com/Shannon-NJIT/MiniProject1/blob/master/Class.md) also has various methods in the calculator for addition, subtraction, and division.
