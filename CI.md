# Continuous Integration

In this file, I will explain how Continuous Integration will improve productivity and competitiveness of a company.

Continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company in three ways: detects error, compliments automated deployment, and frequent deployment. Continuous integration is a test on code to check for any errors before it goes into production. It automates the process of turning working code into a running system. As developers are working together on a project, it increases the likelihood for error/bugs. Continuous integration solves for this by detecting errors quickly and allowing developers to fix the problem then integrate again. Without having continuous integration, a bug problem can grow and be harder to detect. This may have an effect on a developer’s morale as he/she will give up trying to find errors. It reduces productivity and efficiency. Additionally, continuous integration improves the idea of frequent deployment. Developers can commit more features and collaborate more effectively. From an end-user perspective, this enhances a customer’s experience using a particular software. Continuous integration also compliments automated deployment. Automated deployment is taking code and instantly pushing to production. With a combination of continuous integration and automated deployment, a reliable product is delivered to the customer.
