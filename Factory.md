A factory method is a creational design pattern. Use factory method to implement a factory pattern. It allows you to create an object based on a specified string. The object created is determined by the string passed through the method. The benefit of using a factory method pattern is that additional functionality could be added to a new string and class. There would be no need to read the source code. When you create a function, the factory will take a string input and output an object.
