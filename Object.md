# OBJECT

Objects are part of a [class](https://github.com/Shannon-NJIT/MiniProject1/blob/master/Class.md) and have variables and other behavior associated with them. Objects have properties, such as results from calculations. For example, an object is something that can be bought at the store such as a calculator. In Figure 1 for [Class](https://github.com/Shannon-NJIT/MiniProject1/blob/master/Class.md), there is some code for the calculator that includes instantiation, setting the starting value for result to zero, and the different methods and their properties.
