In this section, I will introduce and explain some useful Git Commands (Push, pull, Remote Add/Remove/Show, Status, Master Branch


Push – git push is the best way to “push” commits from your local repository into a remote repository (GitHub). To push onto a master repository your code will look like this.

        Git push origin master (show example)
        Once you push your commits onto a remote repository, the changes will be reflected on your remote repository(GitHub)


Pull  - git pull takes all the changes you don’t have from one repository (git fetch) and merges (git merge) those changes into a branch you are currently working on.
