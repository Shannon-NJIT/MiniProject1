A **clone** is a copy of the repository, but it is an independent copy. Bi-directional changes are not made like with a fork. The user can clone from the remote repository onto their personal computer and make changes as needed on their branch. Changes made on a clone of a forked repository will not be seen by the original creator of the repository.
