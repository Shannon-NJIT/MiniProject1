# FORK

A **fork** is a copy of the [repository](https://github.com/Shannon-NJIT/MiniProject1/blob/master/GitCommands/Repository.md) that allows changes to be brought to the original account. After a user [forks](https://github.com/Shannon-NJIT/MiniProject1/blob/master/GitCommands/Fork.md) someoneâ€™s repository, it will be added to their account on Github. The user can then [clone](https://github.com/Shannon-NJIT/MiniProject1/blob/master/GitCommands/Clone.md) their forked repository onto their laptop and make edits and additions as needed. After committing and pushing to their forked repository, then the user can make a pull request for changes to be brought to the original repository. This allows for bi-directional change. The Figure below shows the workflow involved with forking on Github.
