# COMMIT

A  **commit** can be a task (like a file being created), a fix (an edit to a file), or a feature (something added to a file that is new). Commits can be used to add a message to the changes being made to the repository. For example, after a file is added to a project then the user will use “git commit -m (file name)” and include a message such as “Feature: added a definition to the file” so that when it is pushed to the repository, there is a clear reason for why the commit was made and what happened. Some commits made to this project can be seen in Figure 1 below.
