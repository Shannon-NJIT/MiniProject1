In this markdown file, I will explain what a Master Branch is, with an example.

When you clone a remote repository onto your local, a master branch is created. The master branch is the starting branch of your work. When collaborating with otherâ€™s it is the main copy. Therefore, it is common practice to work off branches (copies) until code is ready to be push onto the master branch.
