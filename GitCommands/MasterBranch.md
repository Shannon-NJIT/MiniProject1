# Master Branch

In this markdown file, I will define and explain **Master Branch**.

When you clone a remote repository onto your local, a **master branch** is created. The master branch is the starting branch of your work. When collaborating with otherâ€™s it is the main copy. Therefore, it is common practice to work on branches (copies) until code is ready to be pushed onto the master branch.

In the example, C1 is the master branch. C2,C3, and C4 are commits made to the master.
