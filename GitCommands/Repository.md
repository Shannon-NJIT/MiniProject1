The **repository** is a folder where all files of the project are stored. Making the repository is the first step of the project. This is where changes are made and history is kept as well. There is also a remote repository which is the repository outside the user’s system. For example, if I clone the repository onto my laptop from Github, then the repository on Github is the remote repository. In regards to this project, the repository I forked from Shannon is “ncl7/MiniProject1”.
