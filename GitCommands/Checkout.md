# CHECKOUT

The **checkout** command is used to switch between branches and navigate where the user is working in the repository. The user needs to checkout the branch that they are making changes to. The user can also checkout commits and files. After checking out a branch, all new commits will be made on that branch. A user could create a new branch and check it out in the same statement by using “git checkout -b (new branch name)”. A user could also choose which existing branch to have the new branch be a part of. For example: “git checkout -b (new branch) (existing branch)” will make a new branch from the existing one.
