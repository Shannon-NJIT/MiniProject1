# Git Push

On this page, I will explain **Git Push** and its significance.

Git push is the best way to “push” commits from your local repository into a remote repository (ex.GitHub). Once you push your commits onto a remote repository, the changes will be reflected on your remote repository(ex.GitHub)

The diagram below shows one commit (highlighted in orange) ready to be pushed back onto the remote. Once it is pushed, the commit will be reflected onto the remote master branch.
