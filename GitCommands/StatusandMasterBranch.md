In this file, we will talk through Git Terms Status and Master Branch

Status – git status informs you of what changes will be made before deciding to commit. It is the difference between the working file and last commit. Git status lets you know what would be committed and could be committed by using git add then git commit.

Master Branch – when you clone a remote repository onto your local, a master branch is created. The master branch is the starting branch of your work. When collaborating with other’s it is the main copy. Therefore, it is common practice to work off branches (copies) until code is ready to be push onto the master branch.
