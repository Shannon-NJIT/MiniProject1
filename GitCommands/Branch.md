A **branch** is a copy of the repository, similar to a new version. The branch is where a member of the team can commit their changes and make edits to avoid working on the master branch. After work is completed on the branch, then the user can submit a pull request to their team member to merge their work on the original repository. The master branch is the master copy of the project that is a working document and would be the effective version.
