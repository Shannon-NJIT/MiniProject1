# GIT BRANCH

A **branch** is a copy of the repository, similar to a new version. The branch is where a member of the team can commit their changes and make edits to avoid working on the master branch. After work is completed on the branch, then the user can submit a pull request to their team member to merge their work on the original repository. The master branch is the master copy of the project that is a working document and would be the effective version. For example, the feature branches in Figure 1 below are copies of the repository that are being updated by the user, and finally a merge commit is completed to merge into the master branch of the original repository.

A user can checkout the branch that they are working on. See the [checkout](https://github.com/Shannon-NJIT/MiniProject1/blob/master/GitCommands/Checkout.md) page to learn more.
