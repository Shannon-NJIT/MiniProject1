In this section, I will introduce the Git command Status and explain its importance.

Git status informs you of what changes were made before deciding to commit. It is the difference between the working file and last commit. Git status outputs a list of updates ready to be added/removed before commit. If a change is in red, it has yet to be added/removed. If in green, it has been added/removed and awaiting commit.
