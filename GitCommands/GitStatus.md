# Git Status

In this section, I will introduce the command **Git Status**.

**Git status** informs you of what changes are staged to be ‘added/removed’ before committing. It also lets you know if a branch is up-to-date with the master branch. If a change is in red (see example), it has yet to be added/removed. If in green, it has been added/removed and awaiting commit. A developer would use this command to check the status of their branch before committing or pushing onto the master.

In this example, git status gave an output of changes awaiting to be added/removed before commit.
