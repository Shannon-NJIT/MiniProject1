# Git Pull

On this page, I will define **Git Pull** and its importance in the Git workflow.

Git pull takes all the changes you don’t have from one repository (Git fetch) and merges [(Git Merge)](https://github.com/Shannon-NJIT/MiniProject1/blob/master/GitCommands/Merge.md) those changes into your current working branch. Conversely to Git push, Git pull updates your local repository with new changes made on the remote. This is useful because as more collaborators “push” commits into the master, use “pull” to bring down those changes from master branch into a local branch.

As shown in the example, use Git pull to bring down committed changes from the remote into your local repository.
