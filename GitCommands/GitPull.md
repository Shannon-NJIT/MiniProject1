# Git Pull

On this page, I will define **Pull** and its importance in the Git Workflow.


Git pull takes all the changes you donâ€™t have from one repository (git fetch) and merges (git merge) those changes into a branch you are currently working on.

Conversely, like git push, git pull updates your local repository with new changes made on the remote. This is useful because as more collaborators push commits into the master, you use pull to get the most updated master branch.

As shown in the example, use git pull to bring down committed changes from the remote into your local repository.
