# Design Patterns from the Gang of Four

Design patterns are used for software design to solve common problems. The five creational patterns mentioned by the Gang of Four in their book are: 
1. **Abstract Factory** - set of related or dependent objects that are determined at run-time
2. **Builder** - creates complex objects with parts that have to be made in order or with an algorithm
3. **Factory Method** - pattern used to replace class constructors. Object types that are instantiated can be determined at run-time
4. **Prototype** - copies all properties of an existing object to instantiate a new object (independent clone). 
5. **Singleton** - only one object of a class is ever created 

They also mention structural patterns that help define relationships between classes or objects. The structural patterns are:
1. **Adapter** - links two otherwise incompatible types with a class 
2. **Bridge** - separates abstract elements of a class
3. **Composite** - creates recursive tree structures of objects with a hierarchy so they can be accessed and used in a standard way
4. **Decorator** - extends or alters functionality of objects by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class
5. **Facade** - defines a simplified interface
6. **Flyweight** - reduces memory and resource usage containing many hundreds, thousands, etc. of similar objects
7. **Proxy** - provides a surrogate or placeholder object. Accepts requests from a client object and passes them to a real subject object as needed

The behavioral patterns mentioned in the book define communication between classes and objects. The behavioral patterns are:
1. **Chain of Responsibility** - processes varied requests, can be dealt with by a different handler
2. **Command** - expresses a request in a command object, including the call to be made and its parameters
3. **Interpreter** - defines grammar for instructions
4. **Iterator** - provides a standard interface for a collection of items
5. **Mediator** - reduces coupling between classes that communicate with each other
6. **Memento** - captures the current state of an object and stores it so it can be restored at a later time
7. **Observer** - allows an object to publish changes to its state
8. **State** - used to alter the behavior of an object 
9. **Strategy** - creates an interchangeable family of algorithms
10. **Template Method** - defines the basic steps of an algorithm, allows implementation of steps to be changed
11. **Visitor** - separates a relatively complex set of structured data classes from the functionality
