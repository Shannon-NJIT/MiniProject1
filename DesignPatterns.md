# Design Patterns from the Gang of Four

Design patterns are used for software design to solve common problems. The five creational patterns mentioned by the Gang of Four in their book are: 
1. Abstract Factory - set of related or dependent objects that are determined at run-time
2. Builder - creates complex objects with parts that have to be made in order or with an algorithm
3. Factory Method - pattern used to replace class constructors. Object types that are instantiated can be determined at run-time
4. Prototype - copies all properties of an existing object to instantiate a new object (independent clone). 
5. Singleton - only one object of a class is ever created
