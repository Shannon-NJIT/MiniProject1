In this section, we will introduce six Linux commands (cd, mkdir, cp, pwd, mv, and rm)

pwd â€“ print working directory. Use it to output your current working directory path. It alerts where you are currently working within the file hierarchy. It is beneficial because sometimes a user can forget where he/she is working.
