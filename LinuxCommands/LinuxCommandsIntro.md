# Introduction to Linux Commands

Here is a list of six Linux commands to be introduced:

1. pwd
1. cd
1. mkdir
1. cp
1. mv
1. rm

**Print working directory (*pwd*)** - Use it to output your current working directory path. It alerts where you are currently working within the file hierarchy. It is beneficial because sometimes a user can forget where he/she is working.

**Change directory (*cd*)** - Consider your files like a hierarchy. To navigate around your hierarchy, use cd command. It is used to direct a user into a directory where he/she want to work in, also called a working directory. 
	
> An example of how to go backwards in your hierarchy type cd ..  
> If you want to go forward in a path, type cd  <destination>

**Make directory (*mkdir*)** - To create a new directory within your current working directory, use mkdir. Mkdir helps keep your work organized by storing similar files in one place.

**Copy (*cp*)** - Use the cp command to copy content of one file into another. It is similar to ‘copy and paste’. Instead of retyping content that is in one file, can ‘copy and paste’ content from one destination to another with a single command.

> *As a result, culture.txt has the same content as travel.txt*

**Move (*mv*)** - The mv command is used to move from one location to another and rename files or directories. The difference between mv and cp is cp copies content from one source file into another (copy and paste). The mv command moves a file in its entirety to a different location.

**mv is also used to rename a file**

**Remove (*rm*)** - When a user wants to remove a file or directory, use rm command. Keep in mind, once you remove either a file or directory, it is gone for good. It is useful when a folder has unnecessary files/directories that can be removed. Now the coder can focus on only import/ant files/directories.

> *Helpful hint: use rm –r to remove a directory*
