In this section, we will introduce six Linux commands (cd, mkdir, cp, pwd, mv, and rm)

pwd – print working directory. Use it to output your current working directory path. It alerts where you are currently working within the file hierarchy. It is beneficial because sometimes a user can forget where he/she is working.

Cd – change directory. Consider your files like a hierarchy. To navigate around your hierarchy, use cd command. It is used to direct a user into a directory where he/she want to work in, also called a working directory. 
	
	An example of how to go backwards in your hierarchy type cd ..  
	If you want to go forward in a path, type cd  <destination>

Mkdir – make directory. To create a new directory within your current working directory, use mkdir. Mkdir helps keep your work organized by storing similar files in one place.
