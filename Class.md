# CLASS

A class is a schematic blueprint defined by the user to create an [object](https://github.com/Shannon-NJIT/MiniProject1/blob/master/Object.md). A class defines the [properties/attributes](https://github.com/Shannon-NJIT/MiniProject1/blob/master/Property.md) and [methods](https://github.com/Shannon-NJIT/MiniProject1/blob/master/Method.md) that belong to that object. The constructor of the class is what creates the object, which will be an instance of that class. In Figure 1 below, the NLCalculator class initializes the calculator and has numerous methods including: “add”, “subtract”, and “division.”
