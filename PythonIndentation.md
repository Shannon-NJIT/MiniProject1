# How Python Uses Indentation to Control Flow

Whitespace from indentation controls flow by delimiting the scope in Python. The indents will group the code in a way similar to the curly braces in Java or C++ do. Indents in code will indicate that the indented code belongs to the if loop, method, class, etc. that is before it. The levels of indentation are important in controlling flow for how the program runs. Using four spaces to indent in Python is the standard. The indentation also need to be uniform throughout the code. An example of indentation can be seen in the figure below:
