When a code is executed and comes across a mistake, it can be one of two errors. The error could be syntax or exception. With a syntax error, the parser detects a problem when a line of code has incorrect syntax. (SEE EXAMPLE). An exception is given when code results in an error although being syntactically correct. (SEE EXAMPLE). A benefit to receiving an exception is the detail provided by Python. With an exception, Python gives a brief explanation of what the error is and where. Lastly, an exception can be raised based on a certain condition.
