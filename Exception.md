# Exception

When a code is executed and comes across an mistake, it can be one of two errors. The error could be **syntax** or **exception**. With a **syntax** error, the parser detects a problem when a line of code has incorrect syntax.

*Example of a syntax error, above code is missing a , between result and result*

An **exception** is given when code results in an error although being syntactically correct. A benefit to receiving an exception is the detail provided by Python. With an exception, Python gives a brief explanation of what the error is and where. Lastly, an exception can be raised based on a certain condition.
