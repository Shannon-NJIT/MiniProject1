# STATIC

A static method belongs to a class, but not the object it creates. A program can actually execute a static method without creating an object first. If something in a program is static, it has a single instance. Static variables can share data between other objects in the same class and have types for their values. Static methods can be used for functions that do not belong to any specific objects. Static methods are actions. A common example would be the main() method.
