CSV stands for comma separated file. It is a file that stores tabular data from sources like a spreadsheet or database. CSV files can be imported or exported from itsâ€™ resource. The structure of a csv file is usually a list of data points that are separated by a comma. Because of this structure, it can be easily exported and imported into other programs for processing (reading and writing).
