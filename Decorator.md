#Decorator

In order to understand decorator, it is important to define **function**. A function in Python returns a value based on a set of arguments. Additionally, they are first-class objects. A first-class object is a function used as an argument. A **decorator** is a design pattern that allows a user to wrap a function and provide additional functionality while keeping its signature complete. Overall, you can add additional responsibilities to a function dynamically. Simply, a decorator wraps a function to modify its behavior.

*In the example, the decorator happens at line 21. When 'hello_world' is called, it points to the inner wrapper function.*
