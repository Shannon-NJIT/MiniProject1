# Constructor

In Object Oriented Programming, a **constructor** is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated. It is used to perform tasks like assign variables to instance variables, what an object needs to start. A constructor takes the name *__init__()* and accepts arguments necessary to create an object. When a class is created without a constructor, Python creates one by default.
