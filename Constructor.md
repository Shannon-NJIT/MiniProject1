In Object Oriented Programming, a constructor is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated. It is used to perform tasks like assign variables to instance variables that an object needs to start. A constructor takes the name __init__() and accept arguments necessary to create an object. When a class is created without a constructor, Python creates one by default.
