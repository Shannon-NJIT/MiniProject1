# Extend Class/ Inheritance

When a user wants to reuse an object and add unique logic into a separate object, it is **extend class/inheritance**. Inheritance creates a child class from a parent class (similar to a hierarchy). A child class will reuse all methods from the parent (common) and have ability to implement its own methods (unique). There are two types of inheritance: single and multiple. Single is when a child class inherits from one parent class. Multiple is when a child class inherits from multiple parent classes.
