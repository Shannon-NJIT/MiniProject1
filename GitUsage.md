# GIT

Git is a great tool to use for version control and making sure that history is properly tracked on a project. Group projects and collaboration are easily managed, and it helps that Git can be used without internet connection or network connection. This maximizes time efficiency since users can work on projects while traveling, during power outages, and from different locations. Projects can be completed even if team members are from various states or countries and have different operating systems. There will be no delays from incompatible files or programs from Windows vs. macOS. Meanwhile, the work that each team member does is present in git history. Git's versatility and visibility is highly beneficial for a company to use and meet client standards.
	
Git branches are also a great feature for efficient team work. If the team members regularly fetch the updated master branch, then they can keep up with updates while working on their branch. If a team member makes mistakes on their branch and has not merged it or made a pull request, then they would not have to worry about ruining the master branch or another personâ€™s branch since it is separate. Having the skills to use git makes an employee better and overall, a company is more competitive if it hires people that know git well and use it well.
