# PROPERTY / ATTRIBUTE

Properties and attributes are the same, they belong to the class and provide functionality. An example of a property would be the result property. In a program, the results would be stored in the property: self.result. In Figure 1 below, some properties of the CsvReader class are: self.data and self.csv_data.
